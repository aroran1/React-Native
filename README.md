# React-Native

Added some sample apps build with react native using ES6.

Hello World - This app shows the basic set up of an app and also demonstrate how to use common code base for iOS and Android Apps

Weekdays - This app displays dynamically generated weekdays in the app and some elements of styling using flex.

Stopwatch - This app shows the basic stopwatch and adding laps functionality. Also demonstrate the color box layout which is used to display various elements within the app.

To run any of these apps with xcode simulator (for ios), go inside the ios folder, open projectName.xcodeproj file with xcode and run the project. This will open the app with selected iPhone simulator.
